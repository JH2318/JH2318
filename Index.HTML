<body>My name is Jacob.  
    I am currently enrolled in college for cyber security.
    I am new to coding, so This is my first ever coding class. I am ready to further advance my knowledge of coding with this app!
     I am hoping to eventually get the hang of coding with this class.
      You can reach me @a02625404@alabama.edu
       Fun Fact: I usually work alot with computers and cellphones, but have not experienced coding yet.
