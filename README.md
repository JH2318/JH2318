My name is Jacob.
I am currently enrolled in college for cyber security.
I am new to coding, so This is my first ever coding class.
I have worked alot with computers and cellphones, so I am ready to see where this class will take me.
I am ready to further advance my knowledge of coding with this app!
I am hoping to eventually get the hang of coding with this class.
